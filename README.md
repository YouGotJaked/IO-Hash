./output <input file> 2>&1 | tee <output file>

1. How would you use such a program to detect duplicate strings (without modifying the programs themselves, but only using operations conducted on their output)?

2. How would you save space, using the key-lookup that you have previousy implemented, if you were told that the strings were very long, and that many of them were identical to each other?
